Using the same user created in create_user, create another custom-policy that will allow the user to only
Create an IAM user if the word engineer starts it. Basically if the user creates a user called daniel for example, the user should get permission denied, but when the user creates the user like this engineer_daniel, it should be created.

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateUser"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::340752803932:user/engineer*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
